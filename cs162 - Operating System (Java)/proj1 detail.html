<h1 align="center">Phase 1: Build a thread system</h1>

<p>
Stock Nachos has an incomplete thread system.  In this assignment, 
your job is to complete it, and then use it to solve several
synchronization problems.

<p>
The first step is to read and understand the partial thread system we have
written for you. This thread system implements thread fork,
thread completion, and semaphores for synchronization. It also provides locks
and condition variables built on top of semaphores.

<p>
After installing the Nachos distribution, run the program <tt>nachos</tt>
(in the proj1 subdirectory) for a simple test of our code. This causes the 
methods of <tt>nachos.threads.ThreadedKernel</tt> to be called in the order 
listed in <tt>threads/ThreadedKernel.java</tt>:
<ol>
<li>The <tt>ThreadedKernel</tt> constructor is invoked to create the Nachos
kernel.
<li>This kernel is initialized with <tt>initialize()</tt>.
<li>This kernel is tested with <tt>selfTest()</tt>.
<li>This kernel is finally "run" with <tt>run()</tt>. For now, <tt>run()</tt>
does nothing, since our kernel is not yet able to run user programs.
</ol>

<p>
Trace the execution path (by hand) for the simple test cases we provide.
When you trace the execution path, it is helpful
to keep track of the state of each thread and which procedures
are on each thread's execution stack. You will notice that when
one thread calls <tt>TCB.contextSwitch()</tt>, that thread
stops executing, and another thread starts running.  
The first thing the new thread does is to return from 
<tt>TCB.contextSwitch()</tt>. We realize this comment will 
seem cryptic to you at this point, but you will understand 
threads once you understand why the <tt>TCB.contextSwitch()</tt> 
that gets called is different from the <tt>TCB.contextSwitch()</tt> 
that returns.

<p>
Properly synchronized code should work no matter what order the
scheduler chooses to run the threads on the ready list. In other
words, we should be able to put a call to <tt>KThread.yield()</tt>
(causing the scheduler to choose another thread to run) anywhere in your code
where interrupts are enabled, and your code should still be correct.
You will be asked to write properly synchronized code
as part of the later assignments, so understanding how to do this is
crucial to being able to do the project.

<p>
To aid you in this, code linked in with Nachos will cause
<tt>KThread.yield()</tt> to be called on your
behalf in a repeatable (but sometimes unpredictable) way. Nachos code is
repeatable in that if you call it repeatedly with the same
arguments, it will do exactly the same thing each time.
However, if you invoke "<tt>nachos -s <i>&lt;some-long-value&gt;</i></tt>",
with a different number each time,
calls to <tt>KThread.yield()</tt> will be inserted at
different places in the code.

<p>
You are encouraged to add new classes to your solution as you see fit; the
code we provide you is not a complete skeleton for the project.
Also, there should be no busy-waiting in any
of your solutions to this assignment.

<p>
Your project code will be automatically graded. There are two reasons
for this:
<ol>
<li>An autograder can test your code a lot more thoroughly than a TA can,
yielding more fair results.
<li>An autograder can test your code a lot faster than a TA can.
</ol>

<p>
Of course, there is a downside. Everything that will be tested needs to have a
standard interface that the autograder can use, leaving slightly less room for
you to be creative. Your code must strictly follow these interfaces (the
documented <tt><i>*</i>Interface</tt> classes).

<p>
In order for you to verify that your code is compatible with the autograder,
there are some simple compatibility tests you can run before you submit.

<p>
Since your submissions will be processed by a program, there are some very
important things you must do, as well as things you must not do.

<p>
For <i>all</i> of the projects in this class...
<ol>
<li><i>Do not</i> modify <tt>Makefile</tt>, <b>except</b> to add source files.
You will not be submitting this file (<tt>javac</tt> automatically finds
source files to compile, so we don't need you to submit <tt>Makefile</tt>).

<li>Only modify <tt>nachos.conf</tt> according to the project specifications.
You will not be submitting this file either. Do not rely on any additional keys
being in this file.

<li><i>Do not</i> modify any classes in the <tt>nachos.machine</tt> package,
the <tt>nachos.ag</tt> package, or the <tt>nachos.security</tt> package.
You will not be submitting any of these classes.

<li><i>Do not</i> add any new packages to your project.
All the classes you submit must reside in the packages we provide.

<li><i>Do not</i> modify the API for methods that the autograder uses. This is
enforced every time you run Nachos by <tt>Machine.checkUserClasses()</tt>.
If an assertion fails there, you'll know you've modified an interface that
needs to stay the way it was given to you.

<li><i>Do not</i> directly use Java threads (the <tt>java.lang.Thread</tt>
class). The Nachos security manager will not permit it. All the threads you
use should be managed by TCB objects (see the documentation for
<tt>nachos.machine.TCB</tt>).

<li><i>Do not</i> use the <tt>synchronized</tt> keyword in any of your code. We
will <tt>grep</tt> for it and reject any submission that contains it.

<li><i>Do not</i> directly use Java <tt>File</tt> objects (in the
<tt>java.io</tt> package). In later projects, when we start dealing with files,
you will use a Nachos file system layer.
</ol>

When you want to add source files to your project, simply add entries to your
<tt>Makefile</tt>.

<p>
In this project,
<ol>
<li>The only package you will submit is <tt>nachos.threads</tt>, so don't add
any source files to any other package.

<li>The autograder will <i>not</i> call <tt>ThreadedKernel.selfTest()</tt>
or <tt>ThreadedKernel.run()</tt>. If there is any kernel initialization you
need to do, you should finish it before
<tt>ThreadedKernel.initialize()</tt> returns.

<li>There are some mandatory autograder calls in the <tt>KThread</tt> code.
Leave them as they are.



<h2>Design Reviews:</h2>

    <p>To make sure that you have a working design before you attempt to implement 
      it, you should meet with a TA to review your design. These meetings will 
      be held around ten days before the due date, and should take around 20-25 
      minutes. Please bring a copy of your design for the TA to read. In addition, 
      you will turn in your final design document reflecting the actual implementation 
      one day after the phase is due (might not change from the design review 
      document if you design well).</p>

<h2>Submission:</h2>

<p>To submit your code for grading, run the
command <tt>submit proj1-code</tt> from within the <tt>nachos</tt>
directory. It will only take files from the threads directory. We will
grade only the last submission by any member of your group (<del>though the
autograder will mail you test results from all submissions</del>).

<p>For testing purposes, submit to the autograder with the command
<tt>submit proj1-test</tt>

<h2>Tasks:</h2> 

<ol type=I>
<p><li>
(5%, 5 lines) Implement <tt>KThread.join()</tt>. Note that another thread 
does not have to call <tt>join()</tt>, but if it is called, it must be
called only once. The result of calling
<tt>join()</tt> a second time on the same thread is undefined, even if 
the second caller is a different thread than the first caller.
A thread must finish executing normally whether or not it is joined.

<p><li>
(5%, 20 lines) Implement condition variables directly, by using
interrupt enable and disable to provide atomicity.
We have provided a sample implementation that uses
 semaphores; your job is to provide an equivalent implementation
without directly using semaphores (you may of course still use locks, even
though they indirectly use semaphores). Once you are done, you will
 have two alternative implementations that provide the exact same
functionality. Your second implementation of condition variables
must reside in class <tt>nachos.threads.Condition2</tt>.

<p>
      <li> (10%, 40 lines) Complete the implementation of the <tt>Alarm</tt> class, 
        by implementing the <tt>waitUntil(long x)</tt> method. A thread calls <tt>waitUntil</tt> 
        to suspend its own execution until time has advanced to at least now + 
        x. This is useful for threads that operate in real-time, for example, 
        for blinking the cursor once per second. There is no requirement that 
        threads start running immediately after waking up; just put them on the 
        ready queue <i>in the timer interrupt handler</i> after they have waited 
        for at least the right amount of time. Do not fork any additional threads 
        to implement <tt>waitUntil()</tt>; you need only modify <tt>waitUntil()</tt> 
        and the timer interrupt handler. <tt>waitUntil</tt> is not limited to 
        one thread; any number of threads may call it and be suspended at any 
        one time. 
        <p><li>
(20%, 40 lines) Implement synchronous send and receive of one word
messages (also known as Ada-style rendezvous), using
<b>condition variables</b> (don't use semaphores!). Implement
the <tt>Communicator</tt> class with operations,
<tt>void speak(int word)</tt> and <tt>int listen()</tt>.

<p>
<tt>speak()</tt> atomically waits until <tt>listen()</tt> is called on the same
<tt>Communicator</tt> object, and then transfers the word over to <tt>listen()</tt>.
Once the transfer is made, both can return.
Similarly, <tt>listen()</tt> waits until <tt>speak()</tt> is called,
at which point the transfer is made, and both can return
(<tt>listen()</tt> returns the word).
This means that neither thread may return from <tt>listen()</tt> or <tt>speak()</tt>
until the word transfer has been made.
Your solution should work even if there are multiple <tt>speak</tt>ers and
<tt>listen</tt>ers for the same <tt>Communicator</tt>
(note: this is equivalent to a zero-length bounded buffer;
since the buffer has no room, the producer and consumer
 must interact directly, requiring that they wait for one another).
Each communicator should only use exactly <b>one</b> lock. If you're using
more than one lock, you're making things too complicated.

<p><li>
(35%, 125 lines) Implement priority scheduling in Nachos by completing the
<tt>PriorityScheduler</tt> class. Priority scheduling is a key building block
in real-time systems. Note that in order to use your priority
scheduler, you will need to change a line in <tt>nachos.conf</tt> that
specifies the scheduler class to use. The <tt>ThreadedKernel.scheduler</tt>
key is initially equal to <tt>nachos.threads.RoundRobinScheduler</tt>.  You
need to change this to <tt>nachos.threads.PriorityScheduler</tt> when you're
ready to run Nachos with priority scheduling.

<p>
Note that all scheduler classes extend the abstract class
<tt>nachos.threads.Scheduler</tt>. You must implement the methods
<tt>getPriority()</tt>, <tt>getEffectivePriority()</tt>, and
<tt>setPriority()</tt>. You may optionally also implement
<tt>increasePriority()</tt> and <tt>decreasePriority()</tt> (these are not
required). In choosing which thread to dequeue, the scheduler should always
choose a thread of the highest effective priority. If multiple threads 
with the same highest priority are waiting, the scheduler should choose 
the one that has been waiting in the queue the longest.

<p>
An issue with priority scheduling is <i>priority inversion</i>. If a high
priority thread needs to wait for a low priority thread (for instance, for a
lock held by a low priority thread), and another high priority thread is on the
ready list, then the high priority thread will never get the CPU because the
low priority thread will not get any CPU time. A partial fix for this problem
is to have the waiting thread <i>donate</i> its priority to the low priority
thread while it is holding the lock.

<p>
Implement the priority scheduler so that it donates priority, where possible.
Be sure to implement <tt>Scheduler.getEffectivePriority()</tt>, which returns
the priority of a thread after taking into account all the donations it is
receiving.

<p>
Note that while solving the priority donation problem, you will find a
point where you can easily calculate the effective priority for a
thread, but this calculation takes a long time. To receive full credit
for the design aspect of this project, you need to speed this up by
caching the effective priority and only recalculating a thread's
effective priority when it is possible for it to change.</p>

<p>It is important that you do not break the abstraction barriers while
doing this part -- the Lock class does not need to be modified.
Priority donation should be accomplished by creating a subclass of
ThreadQueue that will accomplish priority donation when used with the
existing Lock class, and still work correctly when used with the
existing Semaphore and Condition classes. Priority should also be donated
through thread joins. </p>

<p>Priority Donation Implementation Details:<br /><br />
1) A thread's effective priority is calculated by taking the max of the
donor's and the recipient's priority.  If thread A with priority 4 donates
to thread B with priority 2, then thread B's effective priority is now 4.
Note that thread A's priority is also still 4.  A thread that donates
priority to another thread does not lose any of its own priority.  For these
reasons, the term "priority inheritance" is in many ways a more appropriate name
than the term "priority donation".<br /><br />
2) Priority donation is transitive. If thread A donates to thread B and then
thread B donates to thread C, thread B will be donating its new effective
priority (which it received from thread A) to thread C.<br /></p>
    

<!--
<p>
You will probably find that there are two completely different ways to
implement priority donation; one is extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily
slow, and the other is much faster but a little more complicated. You will not
receive full points on your design if you choose the easy route here. However,
you will also not receive full points on your design if your solution is
unnecessarily complicated, because it's better to do things correctly and
slowly than to do them incorrectly and quickly. [I have an update to
this paragraph at home, but my cable is down. update soon.]

<p>
      <li>(25%, 150 lines) Now that you have all of these synchronization devices, 
        use them to solve this problem. You will find condition variables to be 
        the most useful synchronization method for this problem. 
        <p>A number of Hawaiian adults and children are trying to get from Oahu
to Molokai. Unfortunately, they have only one boat which can carry
maximally two children or one adult (but <i>not</i> one child and one
adult). The boat can be rowed back to Oahu, but it requires a pilot to
do so.

<p>Arrange a solution to transfer everyone from Oahu to Molokai. You
may assume that there are at least two children.

<p>The method Boat.begin() should fork off a thread for each child or
adult. We will refer to the thread that called Boat.begin() as the parent
thread. Your mechanism cannot rely on knowing how many children or
adults are present beforehand, although you are free to attempt to
determine this among the threads (i.e. you can't pass the parameters
<tt>adults</tt> and <tt>children</tt> in the method <tt>begin()</tt> to
your threads, but you are free to have each thread increment shared
variables to try and determine this value, if you wish).

<p>To show that the trip is properly synchronized, make calls to the
appropriate BoatGrader methods every time someone crosses the
channel. When a child pilots the boat from Oahu to Molokai, call
ChildRowToMolokai. When a child rides as a passenger from Oahu to
Molokai, call ChildRideToMolokai. Make sure that when a boat with two
people on it crosses, the pilot calls the ...RowTo... method before the
passenger calls the ...RideTo... method.</p>

        <p>Your solution must have no busy waiting, and it must eventually end.
          The simulation ends when the parent thread finishes running. 
          Note that it is not necessary to terminate all the forked threads -- you can 
          leave them blocked waiting for a condition variable. While you cannot pass the
          number of threads created to the threads representing adults and children, you
          can and probably will need to use this number in begin() in order to determine 
          when all the adults and children are across and you can return.</p>
<p>
The idea behind this task is to use independent threads to solve
a problem.  You are to program the logic that a child or an adult
would follow if that person were in this situation.  For example,
it is reasonable to allow a person to see how many children
or adults are on the same island they are on.  A person could see
whether the boat is at their island.  A person can know which island
they are on.  All of this information may be stored with each
individual thread or in shared variables.  So a counter that holds
the number of children on Oahu would be allowed, so long as only
threads that represent people on Oahu could access it.</p>

<p>
What is not allowed is a thread which executes a "top-down"
strategy for the simulation.  For example, you may not create
threads for children and adults, then have a controller thread
simply send commands to them through communicators.  The threads
must act as if they were individuals.

<p>
Information which is not possible in the real world is also not
allowed.  For example, a child on Molokai cannot magically see 
all of the people on Oahu.  That child may remember the number 
of people that he or she has seen leaving, but the child may 
not view people on Oahu as if it were there.  (Assume that the
people do not have any technology other than a boat!)

<p>
You will reach a point in your simulation where the adult and 
child threads believe that everyone is across on Molokai. At this point, 
you are allowed to do one-way communication from the adult/child threads 
to begin() (the parent thread) in order to inform it that the simulation may be over. 
It may be possible, however, that your adult and child threads are incorrect. 
Your simulation must handle this case without requiring explict or implict 
communication from begin() (the parent thread) to the adult/child threads.


<!--
Not using elevators this semester -KDP
<p><li>
(25%, 300 lines) Putting all of this together, you are to implement a
controller for a bank of elevators, such as in Soda Hall.
See <tt>nachos.machine.ElevatorBank</tt> for details on the hardware interface,
and <tt>nachos.threads.ElevatorController</tt> for details on what you are to
implement. Create a thread for each elevator; these threads
talk to the elevator hardware (through the interface defined 
in <tt>nachos.machine.ElevatorControls</tt>) to
open and close the elevator doors, move the
elevator between floors, etc. The elevator threads should coordinate
with each other to make sure that exactly one elevator goes to pick up each 
set of passengers. For synchronizing the elevator threads, you are free to use 
semaphores, condition variables, or even the <tt>Communicator</tt> 
if you want (though in my experience, using a <tt>Communicator</tt> only makes
things harder). You will also need to use <tt>Alarm.waitUntil()</tt> 
to hold open the doors for a fixed amount of time (you should hold them open
for <tt>timeDoorsOpen</tt> ticks).

<p><li>
(15%, 100 lines) Since you will need to test out your code before you
turn it in, you will also be required to implement elevator riders. See
<tt>nachos.threads.Rider</tt> for details on what you are to implement. This
part is considerably easier, because each rider is independent of all other
riders, and each rider gets its own <tt>nachos.machine.RiderControls</tt>
object (as opposed to the elevator controller, which has one controls object
for all the elevators, and requires synchronization).
Of course, the only communication possible between the elevator riders
and the elevator controller is via the physical elevator device.
The elevator threads should not share any memory
or synchronization variables with the rider threads.

<p>
To test your riders and elevators, you must first call
<tt>Machine.bank().init()</tt>. Then call <tt>Machine.bank().addRider()</tt>
once for each rider. Finally, call <tt>Machine.bank().run()</tt> to run the
simulation (this method returns when the simulation is complete).

<p>
We have provided a GUI to help you to test your elevators and riders together.
To enable it, simply call <tt>Machine.bank().enableGui()</tt> <i>before</i>
<tt>Machine.bank().run()</tt>.

<h2>Design Questions:</h2> 

    <p>Please answer the following questions in your final design document (due <EM>one 
      day</A> after the code for this phase is due). 
    <ol>
<li>Why is it fortunate that we did not ask you to implement priority 
donation for semaphores?
<li>A student proposes to solve the boats problem by use of a counter, AdultsOnOahu. Since this number isn't known initially, it will be started at zero, and incremented by each adult thread before they do anything else. Is this solution likely to work? Why or why not?
</ol>
