a)
-open up the terminal 
-run ‘wireshark’
-Click on ‘Open File’, then select the file with the encrypted message, q0.pcap
-After opening the file, select ‘Edit’ -> ‘Preferences’ 
-Then select ‘Protocols’ -> ‘SSL’
-Under RSA keys list, click on ‘Edit’ 
-Click on ‘New’ 
-Enter the destination IP address: 172.16.23.205
-Enter the Port: 443
-Enter the Protocol: http
-Key File: select the file, q0_privkey.priv, containing the private key
-Click ‘Apply’ -> ‘OK’ and go back to the opened q0.pcap on wireshark
-Right click on the row with the info “HTTP/1.0 200 ok (text/plain) and select ‘Follow SSL Stream’ 
-A new window will pop up and shows the decrypted secret 

b)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA  
The Handshake Protocol for Server Hello used TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA for encryption. 

RSA: 
Premaster Secret is encrypted using RSA. 

c) 
Instead of encrypting using RSA, if the victim uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the attacker will 
not be able to decrypt the message even if he has the private key. For Diffie-Hellman key exchange, 
the private keys are discarded at the end of every session. Therefore, even if the attacker has the 
private key of one party, if the encrypted message is from a different session from the obtained private 
key, the private key is still not able to decrypt the message.
